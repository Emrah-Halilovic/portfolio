    <p class="lead">I went to primary school in Šerići, which I finished as an excellent student, <br>  and after that I decided to enroll in the School of Economics in Tuzla.</p>
    <p class="lead">In economics school, I chose the low field because at that time my desire was to become a lawyer <br> however in the second grade of economics school I heard about one really amazing thing the IT Academy.</p>
    <p class="lead">I decided to take a look at what this is all about and I became very interested and started researching more and more, and as time went on I decided to try my hand at programming.Then I installed an application called PyCharm that was related to programming in Python, that day I wrote my first program "Hallo World" which changed my life
        <br>
        <br>
        As time went on I realized what I wanted to do in life and with the help of the IT Academy I decided on the field I wanted to do and that was Frontend JavaScript Developer.I wanted to make Web Applications and Websites and for the first time I knew I belonged somewhere 100%
        <br>
        <br>
        So I started learning from many applications as well as from various social networks and youtube videos and in the end I finally decided to start with the IT Academy.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">I can say with certainty that programming has changed my life and I hope this is my life’s calling.</p>
